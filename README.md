# Pyxis userland

Freestanding C runtime, native and terminal libraries, applications and boot
scripts for Pyxis OS. Requires GNU Make, the prebuilt
`x86_64-unknown-pyxis-` compiler and a selected Pyxis SDK. The session launcher
also needs the Lua development files exported by the ports build.

```sh
make SDK=/path/to/sdk LUA_PREFIX=/path/to/ports-dev/lua
make SDK=/path/to/sdk hello client server
make -f runtime.mk SDK=/path/to/sdk      # runtime in build/runtime
make install SDK=/path/to/sdk LUA_PREFIX=/path/to/ports-dev/lua DESTDIR=/path/to/guest-tree
make clean
make -f runtime.mk clean
```

`SDK` defaults to `build/sdk`; `BUILD` overrides the output directory for either
phase. `LUA_PREFIX` defaults to `build/ports-dev/lua` and supplies `include` and
`lib/liblua.a` for `session`; the SDK/runtime has no Lua dependency. `install` recreates a payload tree of selected programs, init and assets;
it excludes objects/debug ELFs and removes stale installed files. Application builds consume the complete SDK. Runtime builds use local
runtime headers, exported Pyxis ABI/format headers, build settings and the
SDK's shared shebang source. TLSF is vendored locally with its license and pin.

The Pyxis parent repository pins this repository as its `userspace` submodule
and orchestrates header export, runtime build, SDK assembly, application build
and boot-image assembly. Use its `make sdk`, `make image` and `make run` targets
for the integrated build. Runtime changes reach applications after SDK assembly.

From the interactive shell, `session app://server.pxe` runs the endpoint example.
The server creates its receiver, launches two clients with caller grants, receives
both requests and replies in reverse order. `session app://server.pxe --wide`
uses 4 KiB requests and replies with four file grants in each direction;
`session app://server.pxe --abandon` closes one receipt so its caller sees
abandonment. `--saturate` retains sixteen receipts while a seventeenth client
reports queue saturation, then replies in reverse order. `--close` closes the
receiver after receiving a call and starts another client against a retained
caller grant; `--exit` lets process teardown close the receiver. The shell
delegates endpoint creation and launch authority only to `session` commands.

`session app://server.pxe --send` grants a client send-only authority. It sends
4 KiB and four file grants, closes its sources and exits before the server
receives the message. The server finishes the receipt and then reads the
retained file grants. `--mixed` holds one call receipt while a send-only client
admits fifteen sends and gets `QUEUE_FULL` on its sixteenth. The server waits
for that sender to exit, receives and finishes the sends, then replies to the
held call.

Deadline examples use the session's explicit monotonic clock grant. `--expired`
rejects a past deadline before admission. `--queued-timeout` leaves a call in
the queue until its deadline and confirms that a later send is received first.
`--deadline-reply` completes a call before its deadline. `--delivered-timeout`
blocks in RECEIVE for cancellation, rejects a late reply without consuming its
receipt, then finishes it. `--cancel-full` holds one received call and fifteen
queued sends through expiry, confirming that the cancellation notice arrives
before the ordinary queue despite all sixteen slots being occupied. Admission
remains full until the provider finishes the canceled receipt.
`--cancel-finish` closes an expired receipt before RECEIVE and confirms that
its pending notice is removed.

`session app://counter.pxe` runs a provider with two counter exports on one
receiver. A launched client receives different resource grants, attenuates a
copy and an IPC attachment, verifies protocol matching, and uses both CALL and
send-only delivery. The provider authenticates object ID and actual rights,
then acknowledges natural retirement. `session app://counter.pxe --withdraw`
withdraws an export during a delivered call, finishes its cancellation receipt,
acknowledges retirement while an old client handle remains open, and reuses the
same ID for a new export.

The compiler must include the Pyxis x87/SSE2 defaults and floating-point libgcc
helpers. `mandelbrot` draws through a mapped display buffer using double
arithmetic. Hold arrows to pan, `=`/`+` and `-` to zoom, and Escape to return to
the TTY. It needs display, keyboard and clock grants. Libc supports floating-point
formatting and a small math subset; it does not provide a full libm.
