# Pyxis userland

Freestanding C runtime, native and terminal libraries, applications and boot
scripts for Pyxis OS. Requires GNU Make, the prebuilt
`x86_64-unknown-pyxis-` compiler and a selected Pyxis SDK.

```sh
make SDK=/path/to/sdk                    # applications in build/apps
make SDK=/path/to/sdk hello client server
make -f runtime.mk SDK=/path/to/sdk      # runtime in build/runtime
make clean
make -f runtime.mk clean
```

`SDK` defaults to `build/sdk`; `BUILD` overrides the output directory for either
phase. Application builds consume the complete SDK. Runtime builds use local
runtime headers, exported Pyxis ABI/format headers, build settings and the
SDK's shared shebang source. TLSF is vendored locally with its license and pin.

The Pyxis parent repository pins this repository as its `userspace` submodule
and orchestrates header export, runtime build, SDK assembly, application build
and boot-image assembly. Use its `make sdk`, `make image` and `make run` targets
for the integrated build. Runtime changes reach applications after SDK assembly.
See [import provenance](IMPORT.md) for the original history and dependency split.

The compiler must include the Pyxis x87/SSE2 defaults and floating-point libgcc
helpers. `mandelbrot` draws through a mapped display buffer using double
arithmetic. Hold arrows to pan, `=`/`+` and `-` to zoom, and Escape to return to
the TTY. It needs display, keyboard and clock grants. Libc supports floating-point
formatting and a small math subset; it does not provide a full libm.
